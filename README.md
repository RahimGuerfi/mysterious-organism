# Codecademy Mysterious Organism Project

## Project Goals
Context: Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

## Built with
* JavaScript

## How to use
1. Clone the repository and change directory.

cd mysterious-organism
```

2. Run main.js script with Node

```
Node main.js
```

## Challenges and Credits
This was a practice project from the full stack program at Codeacademy. I wrote all of the main.js file, there was only one page. The only thing given to me were the`returnRandBase()`and`mockUpStrand()`functions at the top of the page and general hints on how to build it.
